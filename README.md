# Udacity-s-Intro-to-Machine-Learning-Coursework

About:
This repository contains the coursework as well as final project for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course. The course involves 
employing and tuning various ML algorithms and culminates with a project that explores the Enron Corpus with the intent of finding Persons
of Interest for the fraud case. The file that contains my work on the project can be found at "final_project/poi_id.py".


Initial note (1/16/17):
As of now, the classifier for the final project satisfies the precision/recall standards set forth by the project description. The code is
rather verbose as is and will be revised in the future. Posting for now to increase familiarity with GitHub.



Thanks for viewing!
